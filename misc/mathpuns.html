<ul>
	<li>Locally ringed spaces are important in the grand scheme of things.</li>
	<li>The Jacobin matrix is a revolutionary way to transform coordinates.</li>
	<li>Shimura curves are really pointless. (source: Hector Pasten)</li>
	<li>There&#39;s affine line between good algebraic geometry jokes and bad
    ones.</li>
	<li>Algebraic geometry: it&#39;s Zariski business.</li>
	<li>Model theory is a very satisfying branch of mathematics.</li>
	<li>Algebraic number theorists have some odd reasons for their food choices
    (in other words, they have nontrivial Chow motives).</li>
	<li>No matter how you slice it, the category of sheaves on a site is a topos.</li>
	<li>A wandering monoid in the category of endofunctors would be considered a nomad monad.</li>
	<li>Logicians often discuss their work over a meal of curry. This leads to fewer arguments.</li>
	<li>Discussions about Klein bottles tend to be one-sided.</li>
	<li>Topological K-theory is an extraordinary example of a generalized cohomology theory.</li>
	<li>The discrete topology is fine for most purposes.</li>
	<li>An epic film, about right-cancellative morphisms.</li>
	<li>Algebraic number theory has some serious ramifications.</li>
	<li>It takes balls to study metric topology.</li>
	<li>Making smooth jokes about differentiable manifolds is a bundle of joy.</li>
	<li>If you take a tropical vacation, beware of amoebas.</li>
