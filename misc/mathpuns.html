<h1 style="text-align: center;">Mathematics Puns</h1>

<p>These are some high-grade (read: awful) mathematics puns I&#39;ve come up with over the years (all original, unless otherwise specified).&nbsp; I&#39;m not liable for any damages caused by these puns.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Locally ringed spaces are pretty important in the grand scheme of things.</li>
	<li>The Jacobin matrix is a revolutionary way to transform coordinates.</li>
	<li>Shimura curves are really pointless (source: Hector Pasten).</li>
	<li>Those who celebrate &tau; day are twice as bad as those who celebrate &pi; day.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s affine line between good algebraic geometry jokes and bad ones.</li>
	<li>Algebraic geometry: it&#39;s Zariski business.</li>
	<li>Model theory is a very satisfying branch of mathematics.</li>
	<li>Algebraic number theorists have some odd reasons for their food choices. In other words, they have nontrivial Chow motives.</li>
	<li>No matter how you slice it, the category of sheaves on a site is a topos.</li>
	<li>People who celebrate &pi; day tend to be a bit irrational.</li>
	<li>A wandering monoid in the category of endofunctors would be considered a nomad monad.</li>
	<li>Logicians often discuss their work over a meal of curry. This leads to fewer arguments.</li>
	<li>Discussions about Klein bottles tend to be one-sided.</li>
	<li>K-theory is an extraordinary example of a generalized cohomology theory.</li>
	<li>The discrete topology is fine for most purposes.</li>
	<li>A movie about right-cancellative morphisms would be epic.</li>
	<li>Algebraic number theory has some serious ramifications.</li>
	<li>Always wash your hands after handling sheaf theory books as they have a lot of germs.</li>
	<li>It takes balls to study metric topology.</li>
	<li>Making smooth jokes about differentiable manifolds is a bundle of joy.</li>
	<li>The study of tropical algebra is a hot new area of mathematics.</li>
	<li>A proof regarding the unit circle was found to contain an error: the writer had committed the fallacy of circular reasoning.</li>
</ul>
