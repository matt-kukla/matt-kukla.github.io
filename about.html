<p>
I am an undergraduate mathematics student at the University of
Maryland and a researcher at <a href="https://www.themathcitadel.com">The Math
Citadel</a>, an independent mathematics research firm.</p>
<p>
My research interests primarily revolve around topics in homotopy theory,
algebraic geometry, and mathematical logic, as held together by the common 
thread of category theory.  Occasionally I dabble in computer science 
(usually within topics related to scientific computing, formal verification, 
type theory, and systems programming) as well.
