<h1>About</h1>
</center>
<br>
<br>

<p>I&#39;m a mathematics student who enjoys approaching things from the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nPOV">n-point of view</a>.&nbsp; But I have many interests outside of mathematics too. I&#39;m an avid listener of music (mainly classical, Russian/Yugoslavian folk, klezmer, and bits of jazz), and I occasionally play the piano.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been known to indulge in philosophy as well.&nbsp; Sometimes I spout absurd comments and bits of mathematics on <a href="https://twitter.com/n_category">Twitter</a>.</p>  


<p>As much as I enjoy inhaling abstract nonsense, sometimes I take a few steps down from the tower of abstraction to indulge in something a bit more concrete such as programming, small electronics projects (many regarding radio/antenna theory), collecting vintage computing equipment, and befriending the local birds.</p>

<p>Currently I am a second-year undergraduate student at the <a href="http://umd.edu">University of Maryland</a>, where I am working towards degrees in mathematics and computer science.</p>
