<p>Typed ordered fuzzy numbers and arithmetic operations, implemented in
OCaml.</p>
<p>Arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers are traditionally carried out
via interval-based methods. However, such approaches are prone to
accumulating uncertainty, which presents issues when large numbers of
operations are performed in succession (as with fuzzy autoregressive models,
aggregations).  Ordered fuzzy numbers (OFNs) remedy this issue by augmenting fuzzy
numbers with a notion of <em>orientation</em> or <em>trend</em>. We obtain
arithmetic operations with unique additive inverses, allowing
for better management of accumulated uncertainty. Orientation has also 
proven useful for modeling <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01980">temporal
data</a>.</p>
<p>Typed ordered fuzzy numbers (TOFNs) are OFNS constructed from
functions of a common family or <em>type</em>. Arithmetic operations
between TOFNs are preserve both type and (fuzzy)
set-theoretic properties of their operands.</p>
<p>The general theory and construction of TOFNs, along with a discussion
of imprecision control, may be found in <em><a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07764">Rings of Typed Ordered Fuzzy
Numbers</a></em>. This library implements several common families of
TOFNs and associated arithemetic operations.</p>
