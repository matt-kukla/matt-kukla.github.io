<p>Typed ordered fuzzy numbers and arithmetic operations, implemented in
OCaml.</p>
<p>Arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers are traditionally defined
via interval-based methods. However, such approaches are prone to
accumulating uncertainty.  This presents issues when large numbers of
operations are performed in succession (as with fuzzy autoregressive models,
aggregations).  Ordered fuzzy numbers (OFNs) remedy these concerns by augmenting fuzzy
numbers with a notion of <em>orientation</em> or <em>trend</em>. This yields arithmetic operations with unique additive inverses, allowing
for better management of accumulated uncertainty. Orientation also has
applications in modeling <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01980">temporal
data</a>.</p>
<p> A typed ordered fuzzy number (TOFN) is an OFN constructed from
functions of a common family or <em>type</em>. Arithmetic operations
between TOFNs preserve both type and (fuzzy)
set-theoretic properties of their operands.</p>
<p>The general theory and construction of TOFNs, along with a discussion
of imprecision control, can be found in <em><a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07764">Rings of Typed Ordered Fuzzy
Numbers</a></em>. This library implements several common families of
TOFNs (trapezoidal, Gaussian, exponential) and their associated arithemetic operations.</p>
