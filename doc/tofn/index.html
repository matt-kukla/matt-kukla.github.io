<p>Typed ordered fuzzy numbers and arithmetic operations, implemented in
OCaml.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers are traditionally carried out
via interval-based methods. However, these operations are prone to
accumulating uncertainty, which presents issues in situations where many
operations are performed in succession (e.g fuzzy autoregressive models,
aggregations).</p>
<p>Ordered fuzzy numbers (OFNs) remedy this issue by augmenting fuzzy
numbers with a notion of <em>orientation</em> or <em>trend</em>. This
yields arithmetic operations with unique additive inverses, allowing
accumulated uncertainty to be reversed without introducing further
approximations. Orientation has also proven extremely useful for
modeling temporal data.</p>
<p>Typed ordered fuzzy numbers (TOFNs) are OFNS constructed from
functions of a common family or <em>type</em>. Arithmetic operations
between TOFNs are intended to preserve both the type and (fuzzy)
set-theoretic properties of their operands.</p>
<p>The general theory and construction of TOFNs, along with a discussion
of imprecision control, may be found in <em><a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07764">Rings of Typed Ordered Fuzzy
Numbers</a></em>. This library implements several common families of
TOFNs and their associated arithemetic operations.</p>
