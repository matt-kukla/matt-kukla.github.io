<h1>Starlings in the USSR</h1>
<hr>

<p>
Throughout the Soviet Union, approximately 25 million nestboxes were 
constructed in an effort to encourage European starlings to breed and consume 
insect pests [<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Starlings_and_Mynas.html?id=Nbx4QgAACAAJ">Craig and Feare</a>].
</p>

<p>
Assuming that all or most of these boxes were inhabited, and each box 
contained somewhere between 2-5 birds (including nestlings), we have a 
starling population to the tune of 50,000,000 - 125,000,000 just in 
these state provided nests alone.  For comparison, in 1979 the RSFSR 
(Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) had a population of 
approximately 137,551,000 people.

<p>
The numbers above bring up serious questions: was there a battle of 
Starlingrad?  Could these birds have formed their own Soviet republic?  
Would their flag have looked like this?

Imagine a murmuration of starlings taking to the fields, chirping
«За Родину!» in starling-tongue.
