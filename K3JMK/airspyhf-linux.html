<h1>Airspy HF+ udev configuration</h1><hr>
<p>
Some driver packages for the AirspyHF+ will not configure udev
rules correctly, which results in the device being visible only with root 
privileges.
</p>
<p>
Check first that the Airspy is visible as root.  Two simple ways
to do this:
<ul>
    <li>Run your SDR application of choice as root, and see if the device
    appears.</li>
    <li>With <code>airspyhf_info</code> is installed (included in many
    distributions' Airspy driver packages), run it as root. If everything
    has installed correctly and the device is recognized, it will print the serial
    number, firmware version, etc. similar to:

    <blockquote><code>
    AirSpy HF library version: 1.6.8<br><br>

    S/N: 0xC85297808AB42583<br>
    Part ID: 0x00000002<br>
    Firmware Version: R3.0.7-CD<br>
    Available sample rates: 912 kS/s 768 kS/s 456 kS/s
    384 kS/s 256 kS/s 192 kS/s
    </code>

    </blockquote></li>

</ul>
If neither of the above work, there may be a larger issue at hand.  Start by inspecting dmesg to see if the Airspy is detected at all.
</p>
<p>
After verifying that the device is actually visible as root, it is fairly
straightforward to configure udev.
  Edit <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/52-airspyhf.rules</code> to contain:
<blockquote>
<code>ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="800c", SYMLINK+="airspyhf-%k",
MODE="660", GROUP="plugdev"</code>
</blockquote>
The device will now be available to all users in the the <code>plugdev</code>
group.  After adding yourself to this group and rebooting (or reloading udev), 
you should be able to see the Airspy as a non-root user.
